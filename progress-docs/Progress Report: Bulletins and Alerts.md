The main dashboard, built using Superset's versatile visualization capabilities, effectively combines weather forecast displays (e.g., Heat Index on map) with disease alerts (e.g., Dengue, Diarrhea), providing a correlated view. Weather data is also a backend component for disease prediction models. Additional custom UI controls exist for more granular, dynamic filtering of weather layers on the map based on user-selected disease types, beyond Superset's standard dashboard interactivity. |
