# Progress Report: Deployment and Training

## Introduction

This deliverable focuses on the deployment of the Climate Risk Information System for Public Health (CRISH) to the on-premises server infrastructure in Timor-Leste, along with comprehensive technical documentation and training for RIMES staff. The primary goals are to successfully deploy the production system, provide complete technical documentation of the codebase and configurations, and conduct a thorough 6-day training program to ensure effective knowledge transfer and system handover.

Key components include:
*   Production environment deployment to on-premises servers in Timor-Leste
*   Comprehensive technical documentation covering code architecture, system configurations, and operational procedures
*   Development of training materials tailored for different user roles and technical levels
*   6-day intensive training program for select RIMES staff covering development processes and system maintenance
*   Complete system handover with knowledge transfer to ensure sustainable operations
*   Progress reporting and training documentation

This deliverable ensures the CRISH platform is successfully deployed in its production environment and that RIMES staff are fully equipped with the knowledge and skills necessary to maintain, operate, and further develop the system independently.
