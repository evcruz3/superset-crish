# Progress Report: API Generation

## Introduction

This deliverable focuses on the creation and testing of Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) to facilitate integration with the mobile application. The primary goals are to enable the mobile application to retrieve necessary data from the system and to submit data collected from mobile users.

Key features include:
*   APIs for the mobile application to fetch data such as health facility information, weather alerts, and disease alerts.
*   APIs/mechanisms for sending information (e.g., bulletins) from the main system to the mobile application.
*   Endpoints for the mobile application to submit data (status to be clarified based on specific crowd-sourcing requirements).
*   Comprehensive testing and debugging of all developed APIs.

This module aims to ensure seamless data exchange between the backend system and the mobile application, supporting a rich and interactive mobile user experience.

| A. Generate necessary APIs to integrate with mobile application                                     | Develop APIs for data exchange between the backend and the mobile app.                                                                | Completed             | APIs for mobile data retrieval (health facilities via `HealthFacilitiesRestApi`, weather alerts via `WeatherForecastAlertRestApi`, disease alerts via `DiseaseForecastAlertRestApi`) are in place. A webhook mechanism (`MOBILE_APP_BROADCAST_WEBHOOK_URL` in `DisseminateBulletinView`) allows Superset to send bulletin data to the mobile app's backend.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| B. Develop API endpoints for mobile data retrieval & submission                                   | Create specific GET endpoints for data fetching by mobile and POST/PUT endpoints for data submission from mobile.                   | Completed   | **Data Retrieval:** Completed. Endpoints like `/health_facilities/nearby`, `/health_facilities/types`, weather and disease alert APIs allow the mobile app to fetch required information. and submit or make POST and PUT requests |
| C. Conduct API testing & debugging                                                                  | Ensure all developed APIs are robust, secure, and performant through thorough testing and debugging.                              | Completed             | API files (`HealthFacilitiesRestApi`, `BulletinsRestApi`, etc.) show detailed definitions, schemas (e.g., `NearbyFacilitySchema`), and error handling. The existence of `tests/integration_tests/base_api_tests.py` suggests a testing framework is utilized. APIs appear to be developed with testing and stability in mind.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
