# Progress Report: Air Quality & Facilities Integration

## Introduction

This deliverable focused on the integration of the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) air quality API and the development of an interactive visualization platform for air quality data and facility information. The primary goal is to provide comprehensive insights into air quality by processing real-time data and to offer a detailed mapping and search interface for various facilities.

Air quality data, once ingested from the UNEP API, would be visualized on an interactive map, with locations colored according to threshold levels. Accompanying this, tabular views will display detailed data, alerts, and trend analyses for air quality parameters at specific locations. The facility component will involve visualizing all facilities on an interactive map, allowing users to search, filter by type or location, and find the nearest facility with customizable radius and directions.

Key features include:
*   Real-time air quality data integration and processing.
*   Interactive map visualizations for air quality with threshold-based coloring.
*   Tabular and chart views for detailed air quality data, alerts, and trends.
*   Search functionality for specific locations and their air quality data.
*   Comprehensive facility mapping, search, and categorization.
*   Proximity search for facilities with customizable radius and directional guidance.
*   Chart-based visualization of facility counts.

This module aims to enhance environmental monitoring capabilities and provide valuable tools for accessing and understanding air quality and facility-related information.
