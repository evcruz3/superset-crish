## Communication and Alerts

### System Alerts (Automatic)

CRISH automatically generates alerts based on data analysis:

#### 1. Disease Forecast Alerts
- **Purpose**: Warn of potential disease outbreaks
- **Based on**: Weather conditions and disease patterns
- **Where to see**: Home dashboard and Bulletins section
- **Action**: Follow supervisor's instructions for increased surveillance

#### 2. Weather Forecast Alerts  
- **Purpose**: Warn of dangerous weather conditions
- **Based on**: Weather forecasts (heat, rain, wind)
- **Where to see**: Weather section and Home dashboard
- **Action**: Adjust field work schedule for safety

#### 3. Health Bulletins and Advisories
- **Purpose**: Official health communications
- **Content**: Disease prevention, health education, emergency responses
- **Where to see**: Bulletins and Advisories section
- **Action**: Share information with communities during field visits

### WhatsApp Bulletin Distribution

CRISH has WhatsApp recipient groups for distributing health bulletins:

**How it works:**
- Health officials create "WhatsApp Groups" in CRISH (these are contact lists, not actual WhatsApp groups)
- Each "group" contains phone numbers of recipients (field workers, health officials, etc.)
- When bulletins are disseminated through CRISH, they are sent individually to each phone number
- Recipients receive bulletins as individual WhatsApp messages (not group messages)

**For Field Workers:**
- Your phone number may be in one or more WhatsApp recipient lists
- You will receive health bulletins and advisories as individual WhatsApp messages
- These messages come from the CRISH system, not from group chats
- Reply to your supervisor for urgent communications, not to CRISH messages
