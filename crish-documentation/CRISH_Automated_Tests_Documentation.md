## Executive Summary

The CRISH platform extends Apache Superset's comprehensive automated testing infrastructure to ensure code quality, functionality, and performance. The system leverages Superset's robust testing foundation with 466+ frontend unit tests, 467+ backend unit/integration tests, comprehensive E2E test coverage via Cypress, and custom performance testing scripts for CRISH-specific functionality.

## Test Architecture

### Testing Framework Stack
- **Frontend Testing**: Jest (JavaScript/React/TypeScript) with React Testing Library and Enzyme
- **Backend Testing**: Pytest (Python) with extensive database and API testing
- **E2E Testing**: Cypress with Applitools Eyes for visual regression testing
- **API Testing**: Integrated with Pytest for comprehensive endpoint validation
- **Performance Testing**: Custom Python scripts using asyncio, Selenium, and database benchmarking

### Test Coverage
The CRISH platform inherits and extends Superset's testing infrastructure:
- **Frontend Coverage**: Configured via Jest with coverage thresholds for statements, branches, functions, and lines
- **Backend Coverage**: Comprehensive unit and integration test coverage for all modules
- **E2E Coverage**: Cypress tests for critical user workflows
- **Performance Coverage**: Real-world load testing with documented results

## Frontend Testing Infrastructure

### Jest Configuration
**Location**: `/superset-frontend/jest.config.js`

The CRISH frontend testing uses Jest with the following key configurations:
- **Test Pattern**: `\\/superset-frontend\\/(spec|src|plugins|packages|tools)\\/.*(_spec|\\.test)\\.[jt]sx?$`
- **Environment**: jsdom for DOM testing
- **Setup**: `/spec/helpers/setup.ts` with React Testing Library and Emotion Jest matchers
- **Coverage**: LCOV, JSON-summary, HTML, and text formats with detailed reporting
- **Module Mapping**: CSS/image mocking, TypeScript path resolution
- **Transform**: Support for modern ES modules and specific library transformations

### Test Execution Scripts
**Package.json Scripts**:
- `npm run cover` - Full Jest test suite with coverage
- `npm run core:cover` - Core packages testing with 100% coverage thresholds

### Actual Frontend Test Files
The codebase contains 466+ frontend test files across multiple categories:

**Component Tests** (Sample from 466+ total):
- `/src/SqlLab/components/**/*.test.{ts,tsx}` - 30+ SqlLab component tests

- Disease forecast visualization uses existing SuperChart test infrastructure
- Health facilities mapping components follow established component testing conventions
- Bulletin creation forms use standard form validation testing approaches

## Backend Testing Infrastructure

### Pytest Configuration
**Location**: `/pytest.ini`

Backend testing uses Pytest with:
- **Test Paths**: `tests/` directory
