# FCM Setup Summary

## What was done:

1. **Moved Firebase credentials** to a secure location:
   - Created `/docker/credentials/` directory
   - Moved `rimes-crish-firebase-adminsdk-fbsvc-02f4df32e2.json` to `/docker/credentials/firebase-service-account.json`

2. **Updated Docker configuration**:
   - Modified `docker-compose.yml` to mount credentials as read-only volume
   - Modified `docker-compose-non-dev.yml` for consistency
   - Credentials mounted at: `/app/docker/credentials/firebase-service-account.json`

3. **Updated Superset configuration**:
   - Set `FCM_CREDENTIALS_PATH = "/app/docker/credentials/firebase-service-account.json"`
   - Set `FCM_DEFAULT_TOPIC = "/topics/bulletins"`
   - Added placeholder for `FCM_DEEP_LINK_BASE`

4. **Security measures**:
   - Added `docker/credentials/` to `.gitignore`
   - Mounted credentials as read-only (`:ro`)
   - Created README in credentials directory

## Next Steps:

1. **Rebuild and restart containers**:
   ```bash
   docker-compose down
   docker-compose build
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

2. **Test FCM setup**:
   ```bash
   # Enter the superset container
   docker exec -it superset_app bash
   
   # Run the test script
   python /app/scripts/test_fcm.py
   ```

3. **Update dissemination views**:
   - Apply the code changes from `/docs/FCM_CODE_CHANGES.md`
   - Replace the webhook code in `/superset/dissemination/views.py` (lines 737-801)

4. **Configure your mobile app**:
   - Subscribe to topic: `/topics/bulletins`
   - Handle FCM notification payload structure
   - Implement deep linking for bulletin IDs

## Configuration Details:

- **Project ID**: rimes-crish
- **Service Account**: firebase-adminsdk-fbsvc@rimes-crish.iam.gserviceaccount.com
- **Default Topic**: /topics/bulletins
- **Credentials Path**: /app/docker/credentials/firebase-service-account.json

## Testing:

Once everything is set up, create a test bulletin and select "Mobile App Broadcast" as the dissemination channel. Check the logs for successful FCM delivery and verify notifications are received on devices subscribed to the topic.
